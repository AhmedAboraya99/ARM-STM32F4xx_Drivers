# ARM STM32F4xx Drivers, Applications, and Projects

This repository contains drivers, applications, and projects for the ARM STM32F4xx microcontroller family. These files are intended to be used with the STM32Cube and Eclipse IDEs.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to have the following used tools:

- An STM32F4xx microcontroller board
- A software development environment such as STM32Cube or Eclipse
- A debugging environment such as STM32Cube, Eclipse, Keil ,or simulation using proteus
- A hardware development using IMT STM32F401CC kit [Black-Bill board]

Once you have all the necessary tools, you can clone this repository to your local machine and use the files in your projects.

## Contents

This repository contains the following:

- **Drivers**: This directory contains the STM32F4xx HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) drivers. These drivers provide an abstracted interface to the hardware peripherals of the microcontroller, making it easier to write code that interacts with them.

- **Applications**: This directory contains example applications that demonstrate how to use the drivers to interact with the microcontroller.

- **Projects**: This directory contains complete projects that demonstrate how to use the drivers and applications to build more complex applications.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this repository, feel free to submit a pull request. Contributions can include bug fixes, new drivers or applications, or improvements to existing code.

When submitting a pull request, please provide a clear description of the changes you have made and ensure that your code is well-documented and follows the coding standards used in the repository.
